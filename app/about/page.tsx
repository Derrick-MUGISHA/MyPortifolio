          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Hello! I'm Muhimpundu Anne Marie, a passionate software developer with a love for creating elegant solutions
            to complex problems. My journey in tech began during my HighSchool years when I discovered the power of
            coding to transform ideas into reality.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            With over years of professional experience, I've had the opportunity to work and study on a diverse range of
            projects, from responsive web applications to mobile apps and backend systems. I'm particularly passionate
            about creating intuitive user interfaces and optimizing performance.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or
            mentoring aspiring developers. I believe in continuous learning and pushing the boundaries of what's
            possible with technology.
          </p>
